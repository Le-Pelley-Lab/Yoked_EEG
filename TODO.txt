Still to do for EEG Yoked:

- Make sure that unique shape target for both sessions (Y)
- Increase practice for session 2 to ~30 trials for eye movement practice (Y)
- Check target positions for codes (Y) + proportions (Y)
- Checked/fixed stimulus codes (Y)
- Breaks experimenter controlled (Y)
- Smaller 5s breaks every few trials? (N)


Thoughts - with current set up, we have 1248 trials total, 936 of which are "post-training", 234 per configuration, 58.5(?) per trial type/config combo. This is not enough, need more like 150-200.

Without having the pre-training blocks intermixed, still only 78 per trial type/config combo.

Potential alternative - reward experiment + control experiment.

Reward experiment:

Pre-training as it is now, participants search for high and low target, suppress high and low distractor. Or alternately, rewarded target, rewarded distractor, no distractor (receive no reward)

Post-training, tell participants that they will not be told how many points they will be earning until the end of the experiment. Only present high-target and high-distractor = ~160 per distractor type/configuration combo. 

Include some "refresher" blocks to keep people reminded of the colour-reward contingencies.

Control experiment:

Same as reward experiment but test low target vs low reward in the EEG phase.

TO DO:

- Initial instructions for EEG expt that reward information will be given at the end of the experiment (Y)
- Same instructions for blocks (summary feedback on blocks?) (Y)
- Adjust total number of trials so that we get a nice even number (Y)
- Include block number somewhere on FB screen so that experimenter knows how long is left in the experiment. (Y)
- Fix up awareness test (Y)
- Change so don't show reward feedback on post-training trials (Y)
- Check onset delay
