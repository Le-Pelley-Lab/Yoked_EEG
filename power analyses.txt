F tests - ANOVA: Repeated measures, within-between interaction
Analysis:	A priori: Compute required sample size 
Input:	Effect size f	=	0.2526456
	α err prob	=	0.05
	Power (1-β err prob)	=	0.80
	Number of groups	=	2
	Number of measurements	=	2
	Corr among rep measures	=	0.5
	Nonsphericity correction ε	=	1
Output:	Noncentrality parameter λ	=	8.6808527
	Critical F	=	4.1490974
	Numerator df	=	1.0000000
	Denominator df	=	32.0000000
	Total sample size	=	34
	Actual power	=	0.8151184

This tells us that a total sample size of 34 should give us 81.5% power to detect a medium effect size within-between interaction

F tests - ANOVA: Repeated measures, within factors
Analysis:	A priori: Compute required sample size 
Input:	Effect size f	=	0.27
	α err prob	=	0.05
	Power (1-β err prob)	=	0.80
	Number of groups	=	1
	Number of measurements	=	2
	Corr among rep measures	=	0.5
	Nonsphericity correction ε	=	1
Output:	Noncentrality parameter λ	=	8.4564000
	Critical F	=	4.1959718
	Numerator df	=	1.0000000
	Denominator df	=	28.0000000
	Total sample size	=	29
	Actual power	=	0.8015104

This analysis tells us that a sample size of 29 needed for each of the groups to detect an effect size of d = 0.54 to Pd (found in the previous EEG study). Qi et al's previous study found an effect size approx equal to d = 2.5 for N2pc to reward-associated distractor (but did not compare high-val vs low-val, only N2pc to high-val). This would require a sample size of 4 for 80% power.

t tests - Means: Difference between two dependent means (matched pairs)
Analysis:	A priori: Compute required sample size 
Input:	Tail(s)	=	Two
	Effect size dz	=	2.5
	α err prob	=	0.05
	Power (1-β err prob)	=	0.80
Output:	Noncentrality parameter δ	=	5.0000000
	Critical t	=	3.1824463
	Df	=	3
	Total sample size	=	4
	Actual power	=	0.8986059
